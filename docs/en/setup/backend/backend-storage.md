# Backend storage
SkyWalking storage is pluggable, we have provided the following storage solutions, you could easily 
use is by changing the `application.yml`

Native supported storage
- H2
- ElasticSearch 6
- MySQL
- TiDB

Redistribution version with supported storage.
- ElasticSearch 5


## H2
Active H2 as storage, set storage provider to **H2** In-Memory Databases. Default in distribution package.
Please read `Database URL Overview` in [H2 official document](http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html),
you could set the target to H2 in **Embedded**, **Server** and **Mixed** modes.

Setting fragment example
```yaml
storage:
  h2:
    driver: org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:skywalking-oap-db
    user: sa
```

## ElasticSearch 6
Active ElasticSearch 6 as storage, set storage provider to **elasticsearch**.

**Required ElasticSearch 6.3.2 or higher, excepted 7.0.0 or higher. HTTP RestHighLevelClient is used to connect server.**

Setting fragment example

```yaml
storage:
  elasticsearch:
    # nameSpace: ${SW_NAMESPACE:""}
    # user: ${SW_ES_USER:""} # User needs to be set when Http Basic authentication is enabled
    # password: ${SW_ES_PASSWORD:""} # Password to be set when Http Basic authentication is enabled
    #trustStorePath: ${SW_SW_STORAGE_ES_SSL_JKS_PATH:""}
    #trustStorePass: ${SW_SW_STORAGE_ES_SSL_JKS_PASS:""}
    clusterNodes: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_CLUSTER_NODES:localhost:9200}
    protocol: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_HTTP_PROTOCOL:"http"}
    indexShardsNumber: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_INDEX_SHARDS_NUMBER:2}
    indexReplicasNumber: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_INDEX_REPLICAS_NUMBER:0}
    # Those data TTL settings will override the same settings in core module.
    recordDataTTL: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_RECORD_DATA_TTL:7} # Unit is day
    otherMetricsDataTTL: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_OTHER_METRIC_DATA_TTL:45} # Unit is day
    monthMetricsDataTTL: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_MONTH_METRIC_DATA_TTL:18} # Unit is month
    # Batch process setting, refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/5.5/java-docs-bulk-processor.html
    bulkActions: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_BULK_ACTIONS:2000} # Execute the bulk every 2000 requests
    bulkSize: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_BULK_SIZE:20} # flush the bulk every 20mb
    flushInterval: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_FLUSH_INTERVAL:10} # flush the bulk every 10 seconds whatever the number of requests
    concurrentRequests: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS:2} # the number of concurrent requests
```

### ElasticSearch 6 With Https SSL Encrypting communications.

example: 

```yaml
storage:
  elasticsearch:
    # nameSpace: ${SW_NAMESPACE:""}
    user: ${SW_ES_USER:""} # User needs to be set when Http Basic authentication is enabled
    password: ${SW_ES_PASSWORD:""} # Password to be set when Http Basic authentication is enabled
    clusterNodes: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_CLUSTER_NODES:localhost:443}
    trustStorePath: ${SW_SW_STORAGE_ES_SSL_JKS_PATH:"../es_keystore.jks"}
    trustStorePass: ${SW_SW_STORAGE_ES_SSL_JKS_PASS:""}
    protocol: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_HTTP_PROTOCOL:"https"}
    indexShardsNumber: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_INDEX_SHARDS_NUMBER:2}
    indexReplicasNumber: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_INDEX_REPLICAS_NUMBER:0}
    # Those data TTL settings will override the same settings in core module.
    recordDataTTL: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_RECORD_DATA_TTL:7} # Unit is day
    otherMetricsDataTTL: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_OTHER_METRIC_DATA_TTL:45} # Unit is day
    monthMetricsDataTTL: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_MONTH_METRIC_DATA_TTL:18} # Unit is month
    # Batch process setting, refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/5.5/java-docs-bulk-processor.html
    bulkActions: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_BULK_ACTIONS:2000} # Execute the bulk every 2000 requests
    bulkSize: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_BULK_SIZE:20} # flush the bulk every 20mb
    flushInterval: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_FLUSH_INTERVAL:10} # flush the bulk every 10 seconds whatever the number of requests
    concurrentRequests: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS:2} # the number of concurrent requests
```


### Data TTL
TTL in ElasticSearch overrides the settings of core, read [ElasticSearch section in TTL document](ttl.md#elasticsearch-6-storage-ttl)

### Elasticearch server settings
Read the [ElasticSearch storage FAQ](../../FAQ/ES-Server-FAQ.md) if you are new to ElasticSearch. 
And recommend read more about these configuration from ElasticSearch official document. 
This effects the performance of ElasticSearch very much.


### ElasticSearch 6 with Zipkin trace extension
This implementation shares most of `elasticsearch`, just extend to support zipkin span storage.
It has all same configs.
```yaml
storage:
  zipkin-elasticsearch:
    nameSpace: ${SW_NAMESPACE:""}
    clusterNodes: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_CLUSTER_NODES:localhost:9200}
    protocol: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_HTTP_PROTOCOL:"http"}
    user: ${SW_ES_USER:""}
    password: ${SW_ES_PASSWORD:""}
    indexShardsNumber: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_INDEX_SHARDS_NUMBER:2}
    indexReplicasNumber: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_INDEX_REPLICAS_NUMBER:0}
    # Those data TTL settings will override the same settings in core module.
    recordDataTTL: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_RECORD_DATA_TTL:7} # Unit is day
    otherMetricsDataTTL: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_OTHER_METRIC_DATA_TTL:45} # Unit is day
    monthMetricsDataTTL: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_MONTH_METRIC_DATA_TTL:18} # Unit is month
    # Batch process setting, refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/5.5/java-docs-bulk-processor.html
    bulkActions: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_BULK_ACTIONS:2000} # Execute the bulk every 2000 requests
    bulkSize: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_BULK_SIZE:20} # flush the bulk every 20mb
    flushInterval: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_FLUSH_INTERVAL:10} # flush the bulk every 10 seconds whatever the number of requests
    concurrentRequests: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS:2} # the number of concurrent requests
```

### ElasticSearch 6 with Jaeger trace extension

  jaeger-elasticsearch:
    nameSpace: ${SW_NAMESPACE:""}
    clusterNodes: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_CLUSTER_NODES:localhost:9200}
    protocol: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_HTTP_PROTOCOL:"http"}

    concurrentRequests: ${SW_STORAGE_ES_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS:2} # the number of concurrent requests
```


### About Namespace
When namespace is set, names of all indexes in ElasticSearch will use it as prefix.

### About Authentication
We only support [basic authentication](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/6.6/_basic_authentication.html). If you need that, you could set `user` and `password`.
For how to enable http basic authentication, you could read this https://brudtkuhl.com/blog/securing-elasticsearch/


## MySQL
Active MySQL as storage, set storage provider to **mysql**. 

**NOTICE:** MySQL driver is NOT allowed in Apache official distribution and source codes. 
Please download MySQL driver by yourself. Copy the connection driver jar to `oap-libs`.

```yaml
storage:
  mysql:
    properties:
      jdbcUrl: ${SW_JDBC_URL:"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/swtest"}
      dataSource.user: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_USER:root}
      dataSource.password: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_PASSWORD:root@1234}
      dataSource.cachePrepStmts: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_CACHE_PREP_STMTS:true}
      dataSource.prepStmtCacheSize: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_PREP_STMT_CACHE_SQL_SIZE:250}
      dataSource.prepStmtCacheSqlLimit: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_PREP_STMT_CACHE_SQL_LIMIT:2048}
      dataSource.useServerPrepStmts: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_USE_SERVER_PREP_STMTS:true}
    metadataQueryMaxSize: ${SW_STORAGE_MYSQL_QUERY_MAX_SIZE:5000}
```
All connection related settings including link url, username and password are in `application.yml`. 
Here are some of the settings, please follow [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) connection pool document for all the settings.

## TiDB
Currently tested TiDB in version 2.0.9, and Mysql Client driver in version 8.0.13.
Active TiDB as storage, set storage provider to **mysql**. 

```yaml
storage:
  mysql:
    properties:
      jdbcUrl: ${SW_JDBC_URL:"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/swtest"}
      dataSource.user: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_USER:root}
      dataSource.password: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_PASSWORD:root@1234}
      dataSource.cachePrepStmts: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_CACHE_PREP_STMTS:true}
      dataSource.prepStmtCacheSize: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_PREP_STMT_CACHE_SQL_SIZE:250}
      dataSource.prepStmtCacheSqlLimit: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_PREP_STMT_CACHE_SQL_LIMIT:2048}
      dataSource.useServerPrepStmts: ${SW_DATA_SOURCE_USE_SERVER_PREP_STMTS:true}
    metadataQueryMaxSize: ${SW_STORAGE_MYSQL_QUERY_MAX_SIZE:5000}
```
All connection related settings including link url, username and password are in `application.yml`. 
These settings can refer to the configuration of *MySQL* above.

## ElasticSearch 5
ElasticSearch 5 is incompatible with ElasticSearch 6 Java client jar, so it could not be included in native distribution.
[OpenSkywalking/SkyWalking-With-Es5x-Storage](https://github.com/OpenSkywalking/SkyWalking-With-Es5x-Storage) repo includes the distribution version.
